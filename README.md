# C++ Practice Repository

## Overview
Welcome to my **C++ Practice Repository**!! This repository is dedicated to refreshing and enhancing my C++ programming skills. After a break of a few years, I am starting from the basics to polish my knowledge and grow further as a programmer.

## About
- **Last Coding Experience:** During my bachelor's degree, I wrote C++ code actively.
- **Current Goal:** Restart from the fundamentals and gradually work my way up to advanced concepts.
- **Purpose:** Document my progress, revisit core concepts, and improve my coding proficiency in C++.

## Practice Areas
This repository will include:
1. **Basic Concepts:** Variables, data types, loops, functions, etc.
2. **Object-Oriented Programming:** Classes, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.
3. **Data Structures:** Arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs.
4. **Algorithms:** Sorting, searching, recursion, and problem-solving.
5. **STL (Standard Template Library):** Vectors, maps, sets, and other utility tools.
6. **Project-Based Learning:** Small projects to integrate concepts and improve problem-solving skills.

## Structure
The repository will be organized into directories for easy navigation:
```
